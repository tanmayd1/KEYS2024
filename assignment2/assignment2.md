# Assignment 2: Introduction to your Research

### Purpose & Prior Research: 

The purpose of this research is to create a new method to help scientists share and combine their research data easily and securely using a data commons. A data commons is a platform that allows researchers to store, share, and analyze large datasets in a secure and organized manner. This will make it easier for scientists to work together and make new discoveries. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of data commons in collaborative research environments, such as the NIH's Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium, which highlighted the need for standardized protocols to manage and share data effectively (National Institutes of Health). Similarly, studies by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018) have emphasized the critical role of data sharing in advancing scientific discovery. This project aims to build on these ideas by making a simple and flexible system for data sharing.


#### Need & Problem Statement: 

This study is important because it aims to simplify the complex process of data sharing and integration which is often a bottleneck in research. By developing a standardized protocol, we expect to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data management which will lead to more reproducible research outcomes. Our hypothesis is that a novel data engineering protocol can significantly improve the creation and customization of data commons. We aim to test this by developing and validating a protocol that researchers can use to create their own tailored data commons.
