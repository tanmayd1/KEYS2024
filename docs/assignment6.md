Streamlining Metadata Management and Dataset Migration

## Short Abstract Here

Efficient data management is vital for scientific research collaboration, sharing, and accessibility. This project enhances dataset management by migrating datasets to a more accessible platform, standardizing metadata, and improving storage efficiency. First, I created a program to access and migrate datasets, making them publicly accessible. Second, another program converts certain files into a different file format which requires less storage space while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the project includes converting datasets to different metadata formats, improving data interoperability. Finally, I developed a user interface to allow researchers to easily manage datasets, integrating all functionalities into one accessible platform. Future work should address the limitations related to this project such as conducting extensive testing and validation as well as allowing for the use of more data platforms.
