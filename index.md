## About

Tanmay Dewangan is a rising senior at Paradise Valley High School CREST Computer Science. He is interning at the [KEYS Internship program](https://keys.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona during the summer of 2024.
 

This website follows the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data principles and hopes to help further open science. 

### Main Project

I am creating a system that will make it easier for researchers to store, manage, and share large datasets in a way that is efficient, reliable, and compliant with federal data-sharing requirements. 

Currently, researchers often face fragmented and inefficient methods for handling data, which can lead to difficulties in data discovery, accessibility, and collaboration. 
These challenges necessitate improvements to promote more effective data sharing, which in turn can enhance research outcomes and reproducibility. 
Not addressing these issues can result in missed opportunities, slower progress, and non-compliance with increasingly stringent data-sharing policies. 

My approach involves using CKAN to create a centralized catalog of datasets stored in the CyVerse data commons, which will enhance metadata management and searchability. 
Stakeholders include researchers who will benefit from streamlined data management and sharing, as well as institutions that need to comply with data-sharing mandates. 
Success in this project will lead to easier and more productive research, improved infrastructure capabilities, and alignment with open science principles, benefitting related disciplines and society at large by making research more transparent and reproducible. 

Risks include potential technical challenges but this can be mitigated through careful planning, thorough testing, and the advisement of Dr. Merchant and other lab mentors. 
The project is expected to take about 6 weeks to complete. 
Success can be assessed through milestones such as the successful integration of CKAN with CyVerse, user adoption rates, and compliance with data-sharing policies. 
Completion will be determined when the system is fully functional, widely adopted, and proven to enhance research productivity and compliance.
