# Assignment 4: Results 

My data will be presented as an image depicting a user interface which will allow researchers to utilize my Python script that I developed. In addition to this, there may be graphs showing an improvement in the efficiency and accuracy of dataset migrations to CKAN; however, this has not yet been confirmed by my lab. These results will allow viewers to see first hand how my project has enhanced the ability of researchers to access and share datasets.
