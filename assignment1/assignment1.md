# Assignment 1: Internship Description 

I am working under Dr. Nirav Merchant for the CyVerse lab which provides scientists with powerful platforms to handle huge datasets and complex analyses. For this project, I will be focusing on the CyVerse data commons, which are collaborative spaces or platforms designed to store, manage, and share data, typically for research purposes. I will use CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) to catalog the datasets that are stored in the CyVerse data commons in order to provide a centralized, searchable, and metadata-rich repository that enhances data discoverability, accessibility, and sharing among researchers, while ensuring compliance with federal data-sharing requirements. This project is crucial as it provides an integrated solution for managing, sharing, and accessing large-scale research datasets in a compliant and efficient manner, thereby enhancing collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility in scientific research. Creating tailored data commons supports the principles of open science and addresses the need for scalable data infrastructure in research.
